# qWeather
A simple weather program in the making:

- See weather data based in location
- User can choose to enable auto update
- 3 days forcast (with a graph)

TODO:

- Add more substantial data - preferably from other resources and/or API's
- Changing/designing new weather icons
- Improve data visualization

Weather data and icons are from https://openweathermap.org/
